NO LONGER SUPPORTED
===================

The functionality that was in this repository is now handled by the standard
Python `io` package in all versions of Python supported by the SpiNNaker team.
In particular, `io.FileIO` is good for binary file access, and
`io.TextIOWrapper` makes that work for text file access.
